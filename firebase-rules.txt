FIREBASE SECURITY RULES CONFIGURATION

To fix the gallery creation and file upload issues, you need to configure Firebase security rules in the Firebase Console:

1. FIRESTORE RULES (Database > Rules):
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write galleries
    match /galleries/{galleryId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Allow all operations on subcollections for authenticated users and visitors
      match /{subcollection}/{document} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      }
      
      // Specific rules for nested subcollections
      match /{subcollection}/{document}/{nestedCollection}/{nestedDocument} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      }
    }
    
    // Alternative simpler rule for development (use this if above doesn't work)
    // match /{document=**} {
    //   allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    // }
  }
}
```

2. STORAGE RULES (Storage > Rules):
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to upload to galleries
    match /galleries/{galleryId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Your Project
2. Navigate to Firestore Database → Rules tab
3. Replace the existing rules with the Firestore rules above
4. Click "Publish"
5. Navigate to Storage → Rules tab  
6. Replace the existing rules with the Storage rules above
7. Click "Publish"

This will allow:
- Authenticated users to create and manage galleries
- Gallery visitors to upload media and interact with content
- Proper gallery isolation while maintaining security
